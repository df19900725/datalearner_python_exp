# datalearner_python_exp
This is a python repository that will give kinds examples for python features. We will test various python libs. These files can also be the examples for python usages.

Currently, we have already finished following tests.

#### Python Multiprocess Example and Test

We know that python has `GIL` that will limit multi threads for all native python codes. However, we can still use `multiprocess` to speed up the python program. In `multiprocess` package, we will generate several different kinds of data and to process them with `multiprocess`. Then we will show the elapsed time for different process ways. We can see that which way will be the most effective way to use python `multiprocess`

#### Dask Example and Test

`Dask` is a very famous python lib which is used to run program by distributed way. It can be regarded as a light distributed computing framework just like spark. In `dask` package, we will show how to use dask, and compare the effectiveness of the `Dask` with native python codes.
